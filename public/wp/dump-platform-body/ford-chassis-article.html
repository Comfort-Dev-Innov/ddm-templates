            </header>

            <div class="blue-article-content">
                <p>When it comes to chassis cabs, Ford offers everything from the versatile <a href="https://www.bowenscarff.com/inventory/new-2023-ford-f-350sd-xl-4wd-4d-crew-cab-1ft8w3baxpee21343/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;">F-350 Super Duty</a> all the way up to the heavy-duty 
                <span style="font-weight: 600;">F-750</span>. These trucks make excellent platforms for dump beds and flatbeds alike. Understanding what each truck can actually handle in terms of power and payload is crucial if you want to pick the right one for your operation.</p>

                <h2 class="blue-section-heading">Engine Options and Performance</h2>
                <p>Ford offers a selection of powerful engines designed to meet diverse commercial demands:</p>

                <div class="engine-list">
                    <div class="engine-item">
                        <div class="engine-name">✲ 7.3L OHV PFI Gas V8</div>
                        <div class="engine-desc">This naturally aspirated engine is engineered for an optimal combination of power and efficiency, delivering <span class="spec-highlight">335 horsepower and 468 lb-ft of torque</span>. It is a reliable choice for strenuous duty, capable of idling for extended periods, and offers impressive durability and performance. For some configurations, a 6.8L Gas V8 is also available, providing <span class="spec-highlight">405 HP and 445 lb-ft of torque</span>.</div>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="engine-item">
                        <div class="engine-name">✲ 6.7L Power Stroke® V8 Turbo Diesel</div>
                        <div class="engine-desc">This available twin-turbo engine boasts a rating of <span class="spec-highlight">330 horsepower and a commanding 950 lb-ft of torque</span>. It is also engineered to handle up to 20% biodiesel, offering fuel flexibility. For even more demanding tasks, a 6.7L High Output Power Stroke Diesel is available on some F-350 models, pushing the limits with <span class="spec-highlight">500 HP and an astounding 1,200 lb-ft of torque</span>. Diesel engines often include a driver-activated engine exhaust brake, which is invaluable for managing heavy loads on downhill grades, a common scenario in the hilly and mountainous terrain prevalent in the Pacific Northwest.</div>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p>The selection of an engine and transmission system is about raw, usable, and flexible power for specific applications. For a dump body, a powerful engine and a robust PTO are crucial for rapid, repeated lifts of heavy, potentially wet materials. For a platform body equipped with a crane or other hydraulic tools, the PTO's ability to operate while the truck is stationary (or even creeping for precise movements) is paramount for operational efficiency and safety.</p>
                    
                    <p>The choice between gas and diesel engines also has long-term implications for fuel costs, maintenance complexity, and overall operational efficiency. For instance, a landscaping company might find a gas engine more cost-effective for intermittent PTO use and lower initial investment, while a heavy construction firm operating in the PNW's hilly terrain would likely prioritize a diesel engine for its superior torque and the added safety of engine exhaust braking when hauling constantly heavy loads.</p>
                </div>

                <h2 class="blue-section-heading">Transmission and PTO: The Heart of Your Upfit</h2>
                <p>All Ford Super Duty and Medium Duty chassis cabs are equipped with the <span class="spec-highlight">TorqShift® 10-Speed Automatic Transmission</span>. This transmission is known for its smooth shifts and is specially engineered to handle heavy demands.</p>

                <h2 class="blue-section-heading">Payload, GVWR, and Towing Capacities</h2>
                <p>Ford's chassis design accommodates a wide variety of upfits, with Gross Combination Weight Ratings (GCWR) ranging from <span class="spec-highlight">20,000 to an impressive 50,000 pounds</span>.</p>

                <p>Ford Super Duty and Medium Duty chassis cabs maintain impressive towing capabilities regardless of body style. For instance, the Super Duty can tow up to <span class="spec-highlight">40,000 lbs</span> with available high-capacity trailer tow packages for heavier applications. This ensures that your truck can handle primary hauling duties while still being capable of occasional trailer work, a versatility that is highly valued in the diverse operational environments of the Pacific Northwest.</p>

    <h1>Why the Mustang Is Special</h1>

    <div class="paragraph-container-01" id="why-the-mustang-is-special">
      <p class="paragraph-text">
        The Ford Mustang’s allure reaches beyond its specifications, resonating
        deeply with performance enthusiasts across Oklahoma and the nation. For
        over half a century, the Mustang has been a symbol of power, innovation,
        and style.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">
        One reason the Mustang holds a place is its robust lineup of engines.
        From the efficient 2.3-liter EcoBoost turbocharged four-cylinder
        producing 315 horsepower to the legendary 5.0-liter Coyote V8 delivering
        500 horsepower in models like the Dark Horse™, the Mustang offers a
        spectrum of power to satisfy diverse drivers in Yukon and Mustang.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">
        The Mustang’s rear-wheel-drive setup, finely tuned suspension, and
        balanced weight distribution create a driving experience focused on
        agility and responsiveness. Available features such as the MagneRide®
        damping system and selectable drive modes allow drivers to adjust
        handling characteristics to fit any mood or road condition, whether in
        the urban streets of Edmond or winding country roads outside Moore.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">
        Design-wise, the Mustang retains its classic fastback silhouette with
        modern aerodynamic enhancements. Inside, a driver-focused cockpit
        includes a large 13.2" touchscreen, a customizable digital instrument
        panel, and premium materials that combine retro charm with modern
        technology.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">
        The Mustang&apos;s cultural heritage, performance pedigree, and
        continuous innovation make it a standout choice for Oklahoma drivers who
        want a car that&apos;s both exciting and practical.

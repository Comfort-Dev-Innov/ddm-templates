            <p>Even with the set pricing structure of CPO vehicles, there are ways to maximize your value.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Timing Your Purchase</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>After New Models Arrive:</strong> When the brand-new model year Hyundai (e.g., the 2026 Palisade) arrives, dealerships often see an influx of trade-ins of the previous model (e.g., the 2023 or 2024 Palisade). This can lead to a great selection of late-model, low-mileage CPO vehicles.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Holiday Sales Events:</strong> Keep an eye out for special promotions during holiday weekends like Memorial Day, Labor Day, and year-end sales events, which may include special CPO financing rates.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="section-divider"></div>

        <h2>Negotiating Your Deal</h2>
        
        <p>Yes, you can often negotiate on a CPO vehicle. The price reflects a great deal of built-in value, but a polite, informed negotiation is always welcome.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Focus on the "Out-the-Door" Price:</strong> This is the total cost, including the vehicle price, taxes, and all fees. It's the most important number.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Know Your Trade-In's Value:</strong> Use our <a href="https://joecooperhyundai.com/trade">online trade valuation tool</a> before you visit. It takes seconds. Having a clear, independent value for your current car separates the trade-in negotiation from the vehicle purchase, simplifying the process for you.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Discuss Financing in Advance:</strong> While Hyundai often has excellent CPO rates, it can be helpful to get a pre-approval from your own bank or credit union. This gives you a benchmark and helps you recognize a great financing offer when you see one.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Be Prepared and Respectful:</strong> The most successful negotiations are collaborative conversations. By showing you've done your research and are serious about buying, our team can work with you to find a final price and payment that feels great.</li>
        </ul>

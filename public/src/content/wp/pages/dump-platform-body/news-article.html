            Beyond the Purchase: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ownership Considerations for Pacific Northwest Businesses</span>
          </h1>
        </header>

        <div class="intro-text">
          Acquiring a Ford work truck represents a significant investment, but the journey extends far beyond the initial purchase. Long-term ownership involves ongoing considerations such as maintenance, resale value, and insurance costs, all of which can be uniquely influenced by operating in the Pacific Northwest.
        </div>

        <h2 class="section-title">Maintenance and Longevity: Keeping Your Ford Running Strong</h2>
        
        <div class="content-text">
          While both dump body and platform body trucks share the same robust Ford chassis foundation, their specific maintenance needs differ due to their distinct functionalities. Dump bodies, with their added hydraulic systems, generally require more attention, representing a trade-off for their enhanced capabilities.
        </div>

        <div class="maintenance-grid">
          <div class="maintenance-card">
            <h3 class="card-title">Dump Body Care</h3>
            <div class="content-text">
              Regular monitoring of the hydraulic system is essential for dump bodies. This includes routinely checking hydraulic fluid levels, meticulously inspecting hoses for any signs of wear or leaks, and ensuring the lift mechanism operates smoothly and without hesitation.
            </div>
            
            <div class="issues-list">
              <!-- <strong>Common Issues:</strong><br> -->
              Common issues that can arise include slow or erratic lifting, complete failure to lift, unusual noises (such as whining or knocking), intermittent operation, and electrical problems like blown fuses or faulty solenoids. 
              <br/><br/>
              These issues often stem from low or contaminated fluid, air trapped in the system, or worn hydraulic components.
            </div>

            <div class="solutions-list">
              <!-- <strong>Repair Solutions:</strong><br> -->
              To repair, we recommend checking and topping off hydraulic fluid, replacing it if contaminated, bleeding air from the system, and inspecting/replacing faulty hydraulic components as needed. Adhering to scheduled service for the PTO system is also critical to avoid downtime.
            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box">
              Ford's live-drive PTO functionality allows operation while parked or in motion, but consistent maintenance is still required for optimal performance. If you still need extra help, Bowen Scarff is available to help.

          <div class="maintenance-card">
            <h3 class="card-title">Platform Body Care</h3>
            <div class="content-text">
              In contrast, platform bodies are mechanically simpler, lacking a hydraulic system or moving bed. Maintenance for these bodies primarily focuses on structural integrity. Key checks include ensuring the body is securely mounted to the chassis, verifying that tie-downs and lighting are in good condition, and monitoring the flatbed surface for wear over time.
            </div>

            <div class="issues-list">
              <!-- <strong>Common Structural Issues:</strong><br> -->
              Common structural issues for commercial truck bodies, including flatbeds, can involve rust, dents, scratches, and damage to lights or bumpers. Rust is a particularly significant concern for commercial trucks, especially those operating in harsh climates like the Pacific Northwest, where persistent moisture can accelerate corrosion and weaken bodywork.
            </div>

            <div class="solutions-list">
              <!-- <strong>Preventive Care:</strong><br> -->
              Regular pressure washing of the exterior and undercarriage can help remove dirt, grease, and debris that contribute to rust and premature aging. Structural damage, such as issues with the chassis or frame, may require specialized repairs like straightening or welding to restore functionality and safety.

        </div>

        <h3 class="subheading">Resale Value</h3>
        
        <div class="content-text">
          The resale value of a commercial truck is influenced by several factors, including its age, mileage, maintenance history, and market demand.
        </div>

        <div class="content-text">
          Dump trucks are often considered a 10-year depreciation asset due to their specific, sometimes limited, use and periods of inactivity on short hauls. While the initial purchase price of new dump trucks can be high, the gap between new and late-model used dump trucks may not always be substantial. However, a well-maintained used dump truck with solid specifications can offer better long-term value, even with higher mileage, compared to a cheaper truck with underlying issues.
        </div>

        <div class="content-text">
          Platform bodies, or flatbeds, are more versatile, making them an appealing option for businesses seeking to enhance their fleets economically. Trucks with dual rear wheels (dually trucks) often maintain their value better due to increased load capacity, stability, safety, and superior towing capability.
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          For both body types, regular maintenance is the most critical factor in retaining value. Addressing minor issues and making essential repairs before listing, such as replacing worn components or ensuring that lighting and electrical systems work, can significantly increase resale value. Upgrading key features like installing LED lighting or adding a liftgate can also enhance value and demand.

                    <p>Central to the Ford F-150 Raptor's legendary off-road capabilities is the formidable high-output 3.5L EcoBoost® V6 engine. This powerplant is not merely about raw force; it is meticulously engineered for the demanding conditions of adventurous terrain, delivering a compelling blend of responsiveness and durability that defines the Raptor experience.</p>

                    <div class="stats-highlight">
                        <h4>2025 Performance Specifications</h4>
                        <p>450 horsepower and 510 lb-ft of torque - engineered for extreme off-road conditions</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>For the 2025 model year, this specialized engine generates an impressive 450 horsepower and 510 lb-ft of torque. This output is critical for the Raptor's ability to accelerate rapidly and navigate challenging landscapes. The engine's design incorporates twin turbochargers, which are fundamental to enhancing its responsiveness and efficiency, providing immediate power delivery crucial for dynamic off-road environments. Furthermore, an advanced fuel delivery system, combining both port fuel injection and direct injection, optimizes fuel efficiency while maximizing performance, ensuring consistent power output even under strenuous conditions.</p>

                    <p>Beyond its raw power, the High-Output EcoBoost is built for unwavering resilience. Constructed with a robust die-cast aluminum engine block and a forged-steel crankshaft, this engine is designed to withstand the extreme stresses of high-performance off-road driving, contributing significantly to its long-term reliability and resilience. These specific engineering choices for the High-Output EcoBoost, focusing on reinforced components and optimized fuel delivery, demonstrate Ford's strategic commitment to not just raw power, but also the sustainability and reliability of that power under extreme, specialized conditions. For a vehicle like the Raptor, marketed on its extreme capability, these underlying engineering decisions are crucial. They build trust and justify the premium price, assuring customers that Ford has engineered the entire system for the specific, harsh use case, ensuring the truck can consistently deliver on its promise of "off-road dominance" without premature failure.</p>

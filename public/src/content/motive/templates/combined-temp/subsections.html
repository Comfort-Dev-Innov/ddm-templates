            <h2>✎ Should You Buy the Tucson Hybrid or Regular Gas Model?</h2>
            <p>The answer to this question depends on your driving priorities. The standard 2.5L engine provides performance that many have consistently described as "adequate" or "leisurely" for relaxed, everyday driving. It will get you where you need to go comfortably and efficiently.</p>
            <p>The jump to the 231-hp hybrid system is not an incremental upgrade but a transformation of the driving experience. The immediate torque from the electric motor provides the kind of "pep" that makes city driving and highway merging feel effortless and confidence-inspiring. For many drivers, this enhanced performance, combined with the significant fuel savings, makes the Tucson Hybrid the superior choice and a worthwhile investment over the gas model.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>32-Mile All-Electric Range</h3>
                <p>The Tucson PHEV is designed for a specific type of driver, and it is absolutely worth it. Its primary benefit is the 32-mile all-electric range.</p>
            </div>
            <p>If your daily commute in the Oklahoma City metro is less than 32 miles round-trip and you can charge the vehicle at home overnight, you can operate the Tucson PHEV like a full electric vehicle for most of your daily driving, saving significantly on fuel costs. It offers the silent, smooth acceleration of an EV for local trips while retaining the long-range flexibility of a gasoline engine for road trips, eliminating any range anxiety. As the most powerful Tucson available, it delivers the best of both worlds: zero-emission commuting and powerful hybrid performance when you need it.</p>

                <h2>Family-First Innovations: Introducing "Baby Mode"</h2>
                <p>Hyundai's commitment to thoughtful design is perfectly encapsulated in a new, exclusive feature for the 2025 Tucson Hybrid and PHEV models: "Baby Mode". This innovation showcases an empathetic approach to engineering, designed to solve a real-world problem for families.</p>
                
                <h3>What is Baby Mode?</h3>
                <p>It is a driver-selectable setting, easily accessed through the "My Drive" menu, that is specifically calibrated to create the smoothest, most peaceful ride possible.</p>
                
                <h3>How Does it Work?</h3>
                <p>When activated, Baby Mode adjusts the powertrain's behavior by softening the initial throttle response. It smooths out acceleration and braking inputs to eliminate the sudden, jarring movements that can often startle a sleeping infant or an anxious pet.</p>
                
                <p>The applications for this feature extend beyond just parents of young children. For passengers who are prone to motion sickness, the gentler ride dynamics can make a significant difference in comfort. It's for any driver who prioritizes a serene and seamless journey. This feature, combined with the available "Sounds of Nature" ambient soundscapes that can play calming audio like "Rainy Day" or "Lively Forest" through the speakers, demonstrates a deep understanding of passenger well-being.</p>

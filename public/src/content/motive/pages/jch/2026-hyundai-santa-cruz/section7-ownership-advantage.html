        The Ownership Advantage: Warranty, Maintenance, and Peace of Mind
      </h2>

      <div class="paragraph-container-01">
        <p class="paragraph-text">
          Beyond the initial purchase, the long-term cost and convenience of
          ownership are critical factors in any vehicle decision. In this area,
          Hyundai provides one of the most compelling and comprehensive packages
          in the entire automotive industry.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-text">
          Hyundai's "America's Best Warranty" is a cornerstone of its brand
          promise. The 2026 Santa Cruz is covered by a 5-year/60,000-mile new
          vehicle limited warranty and an industry-leading 10-year/100,000-mile
          powertrain limited warranty. This is a significant advantage over the
          2026 Nissan Frontier, which comes with a 3-year/36,000-mile basic
          warranty and a 5-year/60,000-mile powertrain warranty. The difference
          in powertrain coverage, double the duration, and 40,000 more miles,
          provides an unparalleled level of long-term protection and peace of
          mind for Santa Cruz owners.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-text">
          Furthermore, Hyundai includes Hyundai Complimentary Maintenance with
          every new vehicle. This program covers normal, factory-scheduled
          maintenance, including oil changes, oil filter changes, and tire
          rotations, for 3 years or 36,000 miles, whichever comes first. This
          program significantly reduces out-of-pocket ownership costs for the
          first three years. While some Nissan dealers may offer their own
          maintenance plans, a comprehensive, nationwide, complimentary program
          is not detailed by the manufacturer.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-text">
          Both brands also provide roadside assistance. Hyundai's coverage lasts
          for 5 years with unlimited miles, offering help with common issues
          like dead batteries, flat tires, and lockouts. Nissan's roadside
          assistance is also comprehensive, with towing coverage typically
          lasting for 5 years or 60,000 miles.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-text">
          When viewed as a whole, Hyundai's ownership package presents a
          powerful value proposition. The combination of a longer warranty and
          included scheduled maintenance provides a tangible financial benefit
          and instills confidence, making a strong case for the Santa Cruz as
          the smarter long-term investment.

Is the 2.3-Liter EcoBoost Mustang Worth It?
For drivers in Bethany and Warr Acres seeking a balance between performance and efficiency, the 2.3-liter EcoBoost Mustang is an appealing option. This turbocharged four-cylinder engine generates a lively 315 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque, offering spirited acceleration with a 0-60 mph time around 5.8 seconds and a top speed near 145 mph.
While it doesn’t have the deep growl of the V8 models, the EcoBoost Mustang provides adequate power for most driving scenarios in Oklahoma City’s varied traffic and road conditions. Its fuel economy is competitive, with EPA estimates around 28 mpg combined, making it more practical for daily commuting than larger engines.
Some drivers note that the EcoBoost’s engine noise is artificially enhanced inside the cabin to simulate the V8’s rumble, a common modern practice to meet noise regulations. Despite this, it delivers a satisfying driving experience, especially when paired with the 10-speed automatic transmission.
The EcoBoost’s size and weight mean it can feel less nimble than smaller sports cars on tight roads, but it holds well on sweeping curves and highways, making it a solid choice for those who want Mustang style and performance without the fuel costs of a V8.
 
Mustang Speed and Performance
The Ford Mustang has an undeniable reputation as a fast car, and specific models prove this claim with impressive statistics. The 2013 Shelby GT500, for example, features a 5.8-liter supercharged V8 engine producing 662 horsepower, accelerating from 0 to 60 mph in just 3.5 seconds, with a top speed of 200 mph. For Oklahoma City thrill-seekers, these figures offer an exhilarating driving experience.
Newer models like the 2020 Shelby GT500 elevate performance further with 760 horsepower from a 5.2-liter supercharged V8 and a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission, reaching 0-60 mph in 3.3 seconds. Track-focused trims such as the GT350 and GT350R provide precise handling and aerodynamic enhancements suited for spirited driving.
Safety is a priority even at high speeds. Mustangs come equipped with advanced features like adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitoring, and electronic stability control, ensuring that drivers in Yukon and surrounding communities can enjoy their Mustang with confidence.

      <h1>Mustang Speed and Performance</h1>
      <p class="paragraph-text">
        The Ford Mustang has an undeniable reputation as a fast car, and
        specific models prove this claim with impressive statistics. The 2013
        Shelby GT500, for example, features a 5.8-liter supercharged V8 engine
        producing 662 horsepower, accelerating from 0 to 60 mph in just 3.5
        seconds, with a top speed of 200 mph. For Oklahoma City thrill-seekers,
        these figures offer an exhilarating driving experience.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">
        Newer models like the 2020 Shelby GT500 elevate performance further with
        760 horsepower from a 5.2-liter supercharged V8 and a seven-speed
        dual-clutch transmission, reaching 0-60 mph in 3.3 seconds.
        Track-focused trims such as the GT350 and GT350R provide precise
        handling and aerodynamic enhancements suited for spirited driving.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">
        Safety is a priority even at high speeds. Mustangs come equipped with
        advanced features like adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitoring,
        and electronic stability control, ensuring that drivers in Yukon and
        surrounding communities can enjoy their Mustang with confidence.

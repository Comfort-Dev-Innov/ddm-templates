        The Exterior and Interior Cabin Design: Santa Cruz over Frontier
      </h2>

      <div class="paragraph-container-01">
        <p class="paragraph-text">
          The interior design of each vehicle is a direct reflection of its
          overall philosophy, with the Santa Cruz offering a tech-forward,
          SUV-like sanctuary and the Frontier providing a functional, durable
          command center.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-text">
          The cabin of the 2026 Santa Cruz is a showcase of modern design,
          closely mirroring the sophisticated interior of the Tucson SUV. It
          features a driver-centric, wraparound cockpit that creates an
          immersive experience. On upper trims like the XRT and Limited, this is
          elevated by a stunning "glass cockpit" effect, created by a seamless
          panel housing both a 12.3-inch fully digital instrument cluster and a
          12.3-inch high-resolution touchscreen navigation system. The
          widespread availability of wireless Apple CarPlay® and Android Auto™,
          along with premium features like a Bose audio system and the
          innovative Hyundai Digital Key, which allows your smartphone to
          function as a key, cements its position as the technology leader.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-text">
          The 2026 Frontier's interior is designed with ruggedness and
          straightforward functionality in mind. The layout is more traditional
          and upright, with large, easy-to-use controls that can be operated
          even with gloves on. The materials are chosen for durability, fitting
          the vehicle's work-ready persona. While it is equipped with modern
          technology, including a standard 8-inch touchscreen on the S trim and
          a large 12.3-inch screen on SV and PRO grades, the overall design is
          more conservative. Wireless smartphone integration is available on SV
          and higher trims, and a premium Fender audio system is optional. The
          Frontier's cabin is a comfortable and well-built space that feels
          perfectly suited to a traditional truck.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-text">
          For the buyer cross-shopping with compact SUVs, the Santa Cruz's
          interior will feel both familiar and aspirational, offering a clear
          advantage in perceived quality and technological "wow factor." For the
          buyer who is already a truck owner or prefers a more utilitarian
          aesthetic, the Frontier's durable and functional cabin will feel right
          at home.

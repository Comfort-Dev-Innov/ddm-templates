      <h1>Customer Perspectives on Mustang Practicality</h1>
      <p class="paragraph-text">
        Drivers from Oklahoma City, Mustang, and Edmond share mixed but
        generally positive views on the practicality of Mustang. While fuel
        economy is often noted as lower compared to economy vehicles, the
        Mustang’s combination of comfort, engine power, and interior quality
        wins many fans.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">
        Many owners highlight the Mustang’s stylish design and thrilling
        performance as compensations for any trade-offs in mileage or rear-seat
        space. The car’s solid build quality and advanced technology features,
        such as the SYNC infotainment system and driver-assistance packages,
        contribute to its appeal as a daily driver for those who value
        excitement on the road.

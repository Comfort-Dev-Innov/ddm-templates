      <h1>Transmission Choices and Shifting</h1>
      <p class="paragraph-text">
        <strong>
          Mustang buyers in Piedmont and surrounding areas have multiple
          transmission options to fit their driving style and preferences. The
          2025 Ford Mustang models come with either a 10-speed SelectShift®
          automatic or a 6-speed manual transmission, delivering both
          convenience and engagement.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">
        The 10-speed SelectShift® automatic transmission, standard on all
        EcoBoost trims and available on others, offers smooth gear changes and
        includes paddle shifters mounted on the steering wheel. This setup is
        ideal for drivers who want effortless gear shifts in traffic-heavy
        Oklahoma City commutes or relaxed cruising. The automatic&apos;s
        industry-first remote rev feature allows Mustang owners to trigger the
        engine&apos;s roar remotely, adding to the fun factor without
        sacrificing practicality.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">
        For enthusiasts who enjoy complete control, the 6-speed manual
        transmission is standard on all GT trims and offers rev-matching
        technology. This ensures smooth gear changes at any speed, reducing wear
        and enhancing performance during spirited drives on open roads near
        Mustang or Edmond. The Dark Horse™ model offers an exclusive 6-speed
        manual transmission with no-lift shifting, allowing drivers to shift
        gears without lifting off the throttle, a feature prized by track-day
        enthusiasts.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">
        Both transmission types meet modern performance standards and offer a
        driving experience tailored to various Oklahoma lifestyles. Whether
        navigating city streets or pushing the Mustang on country roads, you can
        choose a transmission that fits your needs.

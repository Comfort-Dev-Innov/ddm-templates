            <p class="intro-paragraph">The 2025 Hyundai Santa Fe is offered in <span class="highlight-span">five distinct gasoline trims</span>—SE, SEL, XRT, Limited, and Calligraphy—and <span class="highlight-span">three hybrid trims</span>—SEL, Limited, and Calligraphy. Each level is thoughtfully curated with a unique combination of features, style, and capability, ensuring there is a perfect Santa Fe for every need and every budget.</p>
            
            <p class="intro-paragraph">One of the most remarkable aspects of the new Santa Fe is how Hyundai has made <span class="highlight-span">premium technology accessible across the lineup</span>. High-end features that were once the exclusive domain of luxury-tier models are now available starting from the entry-level trim. This approach redefines the meaning of "standard," providing incredible value at every step.</p>
            
            <p class="intro-paragraph">Let's take a detailed tour of what each trim offers you.</p>

                <div class="details-section">
                    <p class="description-text">It's important to think of the Santa Fe SE not as a "base" model, but as the incredibly well-equipped and intelligent starting point for your family's adventures. The SE is packed with an astonishing level of standard technology, safety, and convenience, making it one of the best values on the road today for a three-row SUV.</p>
                    
                    <div class="feature-highlight">
                        <p class="description-text">Right from the start, the SE addresses a primary need for many Oklahoma families: space. It comes standard with third-row seating, providing capacity for up to seven passengers. This means you have the flexibility to bring your kids and their friends along for a day of fun at the Science Museum Oklahoma or to a thrilling Oklahoma City Dodgers game at the Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p class="description-text">The centerpiece of the SE's modern cabin is a stunning 12.3-inch infotainment touchscreen, a feature typically reserved for much more expensive vehicles. This large, vibrant display is your hub for entertainment and connectivity, and it includes wireless Apple CarPlay® and Android Auto™ as standard. This allows you to seamlessly integrate your smartphone for navigation, music, and hands-free calls without ever needing to fumble with a cord.</p>
                    
                    <p class="description-text">Inside, the SE is designed for real life. The seats are covered in YES Essentials® stain-resistant cloth, a practical and durable material that offers peace of mind for parents dealing with the inevitable spills that come with family outings. Convenience is also paramount. A hands-free smart liftgate with auto open is standard, making it incredibly easy to load up groceries or pack luggage for a weekend trip, even when your hands are full.</p>
                    
                    <div class="feature-highlight">
                        <p class="description-text">Crucially, Hyundai makes no compromises on safety. The SE trim includes a comprehensive suite of Hyundai SmartSense driver-assistance features. This includes Forward Collision-Avoidance Assist with Pedestrian Detection, Blind-Spot Collision Warning, Rear Cross-Traffic Collision-Avoidance Assist, and Lane Keeping Assist. This robust safety net provides an extra layer of protection and peace of mind on every drive, whether you're on the school run or navigating a busy highway.</p>

                    <p class="description-text">The Santa Fe SEL builds upon the SE's excellent foundation, adding a strategic selection of comfort, technology, and style upgrades that hit the "sweet spot" for a vast range of Oklahoma drivers. This trim represents a perfect balance of luxury and practicality, enhancing your daily drive in meaningful ways.</p>
                    
                    <div class="feature-highlight">
                        <p class="description-text">The most immediate upgrade you'll feel is in the cabin's comfort. The SEL introduces premium H-Tex® seating surfaces, which offer the sophisticated look and feel of leather with enhanced durability. The front seats become heated, a welcome luxury during Oklahoma's chilly winter mornings when temperatures can dip below freezing. The driver's seat is upgraded to an 8-way power-adjustable unit with 2-way power lumbar support, making it easy to find your perfect driving position for long trips.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p class="description-text">The SEL also receives a significant technology boost. A wireless device charging pad is added to the center console, eliminating the need for charging cables for compatible smartphones. You also get the highly advanced Hyundai Digital Key 2. This feature transforms your smartphone into your vehicle key, allowing you to lock, unlock, and start the Santa Fe. You can even securely share a digital key with a family member or friend via text message, offering a new level of convenience.</p>
                    
                    <p class="description-text">On the exterior, the SEL adds standard roof rails, providing the foundation for adventure. With the simple addition of crossbars, you're ready to mount a cargo box for a family vacation or a kayak rack for a peaceful paddle on the Oklahoma River. Finally, dual-zone automatic climate control becomes standard, allowing the driver and front passenger to set their own individual temperature preferences for personalized comfort.</p>

                    <p class="description-text">For the Oklahoman whose adventures don't stop where the pavement ends, the Santa Fe XRT is the perfect companion. This trim is purpose-built for exploration, equipped with the hardware and style to confidently tackle the state's diverse and rugged terrain. It's for the driver who heads to the Wichita Mountains for a hike, explores the trails near Grand Lake, or seeks out the challenge of an off-road park.</p>
                    
                    <div class="feature-highlight">
                        <p class="description-text">The XRT's capability starts with its standard HTRAC® All-Wheel Drive system. This is paired with a rugged suspension that provides an additional 1.3 inches of ground clearance (for a total of 8.3 inches), giving you more room to clear obstacles on uneven trails. It rides on distinctive 18-inch dark alloy wheels wrapped in aggressive all-terrain tires, which provide superior grip on dirt, gravel, and mud compared to standard highway tires.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p class="description-text">The XRT is also the most capable tower in the Santa Fe lineup. Its towing capacity is increased to an impressive 4,500 pounds, making it the clear choice for hauling heavier boats, campers, or trailers full of outdoor gear.</p>
                    
                    <p class="description-text">This rugged capability is matched by a distinctive and aggressive style. The XRT features unique dark chrome and black exterior accents, including the grille and lower bumper trim, that set it apart from the rest of the lineup. Inside, you'll find durable black H-Tex™ seating surfaces that are ready for the rigors of outdoor use.</p>
                    
                    <div class="feature-highlight">
                        <p class="description-text">To complement its adventurous spirit, the XRT adds several key amenities. A standard power sunroof lets you bring the outdoors in, while the infotainment system is upgraded with onboard navigation, ensuring you can find your way even when you've traveled beyond cell service. A 115-volt household-style power outlet is also included in the cargo area, perfect for powering small appliances at a campsite or inflating an air mattress for a night under the stars.</p>

                    <p class="description-text">The Santa Fe Limited elevates the driving experience to a true luxury level. This trim is designed for the driver who appreciates premium materials, advanced technology, and a wealth of comfort features that transform every journey into a first-class experience.</p>
                    
                    <div class="feature-highlight">
                        <p class="description-text">Stepping into the Limited, you are immediately surrounded by opulence. The seats are trimmed in genuine leather, and the front seats are both heated and ventilated—an essential feature for staying cool and comfortable during Oklahoma's hot and humid summers, where temperatures frequently soar into the 90s. For winter comfort, the rear outboard seats and the steering wheel are also heated. The driver's seat gains an Integrated Memory System, while the front passenger seat becomes power-adjustable.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p class="description-text">The technological suite in the Limited is state-of-the-art. The driver is treated to a beautiful 12.3-inch fully digital instrument cluster, which is configurable to display a wide range of information. Your music and podcasts will sound incredible through the 12-speaker Bose® premium audio system. Your awareness of your surroundings is dramatically enhanced by the addition of a Surround View Monitor, which provides a 360-degree, bird's-eye view around the vehicle, and a Blind-Spot View Monitor, which displays a live camera feed of your blind spot in the instrument cluster when you activate your turn signal. These features make navigating tight parking lots at Penn Square Mall or changing lanes on a busy I-235 safer and less stressful than ever before.</p>
                    
                    <div class="feature-highlight">
                        <p class="description-text">Convenience is further enhanced with features like Remote Smart Parking Assist (RSPA), which allows you to pull the Santa Fe into or out of a tight parking spot using the smart key while standing outside the vehicle. Rain-sensing wipers, power-folding side mirrors, and a beautiful dual-pane panoramic sunroof round out the premium experience. The exterior presence is elevated with larger, elegant 20-inch alloy wheels.</p>

                    <p class="description-text">For the buyer who desires the absolute best and accepts no compromises, the Santa Fe Calligraphy sits at the apex of the lineup. It is the ultimate expression of Hyundai's design, luxury, and technological prowess, offering exclusive features and an unparalleled level of refinement.</p>
                    
                    <div class="feature-highlight">
                        <p class="description-text">The Calligraphy's cabin is a sanctuary of luxury. The seats are adorned with exquisite premium Nappa leather, featuring detailed stitching, while the headliner is finished in a soft, elegant eco-suede microfiber. The standard second-row bench seat is replaced with two power-adjustable captain's chairs, which not only provide superior comfort for second-row passengers but also create a convenient walk-through to the third row. This configuration seats six passengers in ultimate comfort.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p class="description-text">The driver and front passenger are treated to "Relaxation" seats, which can recline to a near-flat position at the touch of a button for comfortable resting while parked.</p>
                    
                    <p class="description-text">The flagship technology in the Calligraphy is designed to inform and assist without being intrusive. A 12-inch Head-Up Display (HUD) projects key driving information, such as your speed and navigation turns, directly onto the windshield in your line of sight. The traditional rearview mirror can be switched to a full-display digital camera mirror, providing a wide, unobstructed view behind you, even if the cargo area is packed to the ceiling. The center console features a dual wireless device charger, and the driver-assistance suite is upgraded to Highway Driving Assist 2 (HDA2), which adds automated lane-change capabilities to the advanced cruise control system.</p>
                    
                    <div class="feature-highlight">
                        <p class="description-text">The Calligraphy's exterior is distinguished by exclusive 21-inch alloy wheels (on 2.5T models) and unique dark chrome accents that lend it a sophisticated and commanding presence. It also includes thoughtful, exclusive details like a hidden C-pillar assist handle, which provides a secure grip for easier access to the roof rack, and a UV-C Sanitizer compartment built into the upper glovebox, which can sterilize small items like your phone or keys in minutes.</p>

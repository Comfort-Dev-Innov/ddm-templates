            Ford Pro is committed to making vehicle upfitting as convenient and effective as possible, enabling businesses to build workhorses precisely tailored to their needs.

        <div class="ford-upfitting-content">
            <p>This is particularly relevant for dump and platform bodies, which are essentially custom upfits on a Ford chassis cab.</p>

            <p>Ford's chassis cabs, including the Super Duty F-350 through F-600 and medium-duty F-650 and F-750, are designed to be upfit-friendly. They offer integrated switches, wiring, mounting points, and systems like snow-plow prep, lighting, and more, making them ready for a wide range of accessories and modifications.</p>

            <h3>Ford Pro Vehicle Integration System 2.0</h3>
            <p>A key innovation is the Ford Pro Vehicle Integration System 2.0. This hardware interface provides a single entry point to the chassis cab's electrical architecture, digitally connecting the upfit to the vehicle. This system simplifies installation for upfitters and allows drivers to control peripheral devices, such as salt spreaders or light boxes, directly from the SYNC® screen inside the cab. This seamless integration helps upfitters install modifications efficiently and reliably, while allowing them to easily create custom controls for customers.</p>

            <h3>Comprehensive Upfit Solutions</h3>
            <p>Ford vehicles can be upfitted for almost any task, from ambulances and bucket trucks to box trucks, dump trucks, and flatbeds. Specific upfit solutions for dump and platform bodies include:</p>

                    <h4>Dump Truck Upfits</h4>
                    <p>Ford chassis cabs, with their PTO and vehicle electrical systems, provide the foundation for powerful dump trucks that meet various weight class requirements. Accessories can include bedliners, wheel locks, roll covers, and deflectors.</p>

                    <h4>Flatbed Truck Upfits</h4>
                    <p>Ford offers chassis with the necessary weight class, wheelbase, and power to build versatile flatbeds. Common accessories for flatbeds and pickup trucks include ladder racks, storage racks, toolboxes (e.g., underbody boxes), portable cranes, and various safety and security features like strobe bars and backup alarms. Interior accessories such as floor mats, seat covers, and console vaults are also available.</p>

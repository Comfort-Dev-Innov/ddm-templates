    <span>Hybrid vs. Gas</span>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p class="subsection-intro">
      Whether you prioritize proven simplicity or cutting-edge efficiency,
      Hyundai has engineered a powertrain that aligns with your needs. This
      choice will define your daily driving experience, from fuel station visits
      to the feeling you get when you press the accelerator.

    The 2.5L Smartstream Gasoline Engine: Proven, Powerful, and Ready for
    Anything
  </h3>

  <div class="paragraph-container">
    <p class="paragraph-text">
      The standard powertrain in the 2025 Tucson is a testament to refined and
      reliable engineering. It's a Smartstream 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine that
      utilizes both Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI) and Multi-Port Injection
      (MPI) to optimize performance and efficiency. This impressive engine
      produces a capable 187 horsepower and 178 lb-ft of torque, giving you the
      confident power you need for every driving situation.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p class="paragraph-text">
      This power is managed by a sophisticated 8-speed automatic transmission
      equipped with SHIFTRONIC®, which allows you to manually shift gears for a
      more engaging drive when you desire it. On the road, this translates to a
      smooth, predictable, and reassuring experience. It's the ideal companion
      for those long, steady cruises down I-40 or the Turner Turnpike, where the
      engine settles in comfortably, delivering power with quiet confidence. For
      drivers who appreciate straightforward mechanics and a history of proven
      reliability, the 2.5L engine is an outstanding choice. It's also a smart
      choice for city driving, as every gas model comes standard with Idle Stop
      & Go (ISG), a feature that automatically shuts off the engine when you're
      stopped to conserve fuel and seamlessly restarts it the moment you're
      ready to move.
    </p>

  <h3 class="powertrain-subheader">
    The 1.6L Turbo Hybrid Powertrain: The Future of Efficiency
  </h3>

  <div class="paragraph-container">
    <p class="paragraph-text">
      Choosing the Tucson Hybrid means stepping into a new era of performance.
      This advanced system pairs a spirited 1.6-liter turbocharged GDI
      4-cylinder engine, which on its own produces 178 horsepower and a robust
      195 lb-ft of torque, with a powerful 47.7 kW permanent magnet synchronous
      electric motor. The result of this synergy is a thrilling combined system
      output of 231 horsepower and an immense 271 lb-ft of torque. This power is
      channeled through a quick-shifting 6-speed automatic transmission
      specifically tuned for the hybrid system.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p class="paragraph-text">
      The hybrid's secret weapon is the instant torque delivered by the electric
      motor. When you're the first in line at a stoplight or need to merge
      decisively into the fast-moving traffic, that immediate response makes a
      world of difference. There's no lag, just a smooth, silent, and assertive
      surge of power. This characteristic makes the Tucson Hybrid exceptionally
      well-suited for the stop-and-go traffic that can build up around the OKC
      metro. The entire experience is quieter and more refined, giving the cabin
      a serene, near-luxury feel, especially during city driving.

      Conquering Oklahoma Weather with HTRAC® All-Wheel Drive
    </h3>

    <div class="paragraph-container">
      <p class="paragraph-text">
        Oklahoma weather is famously unpredictable. We're no strangers to
        sudden, intense thunderstorms that can make roads dangerously slick in
        an instant, or the treacherous black ice that can form on bridges and
        overpasses during a winter cold snap. For this reason, having a capable
        all-wheel-drive system is a crucial safety feature. While the
        gas-powered Tucson offers HTRAC® All-Wheel Drive as an option, it comes
        standard on every single Tucson Hybrid trim.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="paragraph-text">
        Hyundai's HTRAC® is far more than a basic AWD system. It's an
        intelligent, proactive technology that acts as your co-pilot in
        challenging conditions. The system's electronic brain monitors dozens of
        vehicle inputs—like wheel speed, throttle position, and steering
        angle—over 100 times per second. This allows it to anticipate a loss of
        traction and pre-emptively send power to the wheels with the most grip
        before you even feel a slip.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p class="paragraph-text">
        This is invaluable for maintaining stability during a sudden downpour or
        while navigating a slushy street after a winter storm.

      <p class="paragraph-text" style="margin-bottom: 20px">
        The system adapts to your needs through Drive Mode Select, offering
        settings tailored for specific Oklahoma driving scenarios:

          <strong>Normal, Smart, or Eco Mode:</strong> For your everyday commute
          from Moore to downtown OKC on dry roads, the system intelligently
          prioritizes sending power to the front wheels to maximize your fuel
          efficiency.

        <p class="paragraph-text">
          <strong>Sport Mode:</strong> Planning a scenic drive out to the

          roads.

          adjusts throttle response to help you navigate icy bridges and

          safely.

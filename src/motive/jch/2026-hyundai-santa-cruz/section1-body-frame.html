        Body-on-Frame Overview: 2026 Santa Cruz vs 2026 Frontier
      </h2>

      <div class="paragraph-container-01">
        <p class="paragraph-text">
          The most fundamental difference between the Santa Cruz and the
          Frontier is in their very construction, a choice that dictates their
          on-road manners and ultimate purpose.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-text">
          The 2026 Hyundai Santa Cruz is built on a unibody platform, sharing
          its sophisticated underpinnings with the acclaimed Tucson SUV. In this
          modern design, the body and frame are a single, integrated structure.
          This creates a lighter, more rigid chassis, which pays significant
          dividends in daily driving. The on-road experience is remarkably
          similar to a crossover, offering a composed, quiet, and comfortable
          ride. A key component of this refinement is its four-wheel independent
          suspension, featuring MacPherson struts up front and an advanced
          multi-link design in the rear. This setup allows each rear wheel to
          absorb bumps and imperfections independently, preventing the jarring,
          side-to-side motions often felt in traditional trucks on uneven
          Oklahoma county roads.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-text">
          Conversely, the 2026 Nissan Frontier employs a classic body-on-frame
          design, a separate, heavy-duty steel frame that serves as the
          backbone, with the cab and bed mounted on top. This time-tested
          construction is revered for its durability and its ability to isolate
          the cabin from the stresses of heavy payloads and extreme off-road
          articulation. The Frontier utilizes an independent double-wishbone
          front suspension, but the rear features a solid axle with rugged leaf
          springs. While this setup is exceptionally durable and ideal for
          carrying heavy loads, it comes with a trade-off in ride comfort. On
          less-than-perfect surfaces, the solid axle can transmit more bumps
          into the cabin, leading to a bouncier, less settled ride that is
          characteristic of traditional pickups.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-text">
          This architectural divergence reveals the manufacturers' distinct
          visions for the modern truck buyer. Hyundai is targeting the growing
          number of consumers who desire the utility of an open bed but are
          unwilling to sacrifice the daily driving comfort and superior handling
          of an SUV. Nissan remains committed to the proven formula that has
          long served the traditional truck market, prioritizing ultimate
          toughness and work-ready capability. For the vast majority of driving
          that occurs on paved roads, Santa Cruz's architecture offers a more
          refined and pleasant experience. For those whose work or recreation
          demands the utmost in rugged durability, the Frontier's design
          provides both a practical and psychological advantage.

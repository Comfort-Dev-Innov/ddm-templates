          When you're choosing between a dump body and a platform body for your
          Ford work truck, especially here in the Pacific Northwest, it really
          comes down to what you're hauling every day.
        </p>

        <p>
          Dump bodies are the go-to choice if you're moving a lot of bulk
          materials, dirt, gravel, debris, or anything you need to unload
          quickly. Construction crews and waste management companies rely on
          them because the hydraulic lift does the heavy lifting for you. The
          downside? Those hydraulic systems need regular maintenance to keep
          working smoothly.
        </p>

                 <p>
           Platform bodies are different—they're like having a big, flat
           workspace on wheels. You can load equipment, lumber, or anything oddly
           shaped from any side. They're simpler, too, which usually means fewer
           things can break down.
         </p>

           Ford's trucks, from the F-350 up to the F-750, work well with either
           setup. You've got gas and diesel engine options, plus that 10-speed
           transmission that handles heavy loads without breaking a sweat. The
           F-600 is interesting because it gives you more capability than you'd
           expect from its size class.
         </p>

        <p>
          Working in our region adds a few wrinkles to consider. All that rain
          means dealing with wet, heavy materials that stick to everything, so
          dump bodies need to handle more challenging unloads. In Seattle,
          you're also dealing with tight streets and parking, so truck size
          matters more than it might elsewhere.
        </p>

        <p>
          With so many configurations and specs to consider, it's worth talking
          to someone who knows both Ford's lineup inside and out and understands
          how trucks actually perform in our region. At Bowen Scarff, we've seen
          what works (and what doesn't) across different industries in the
          Pacific Northwest, which helps when matching the right truck to your
          specific needs.

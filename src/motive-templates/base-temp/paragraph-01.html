    <h1>Fuel Economy: Does the F-150 Hybrid Get Better Gas Mileage?</h1>

    <div class="paragraph-container-01">
      <p class="paragraph-text">
        One of the most compelling reasons to consider the Ford F-150 Hybrid is
        its improved fuel economy. According to EPA estimates, the 2025 F-150
        PowerBoost hybrid achieves approximately 22 mpg in the city and 24 mpg
        on the highway, combining for an overall rating of nearly 23 mpg. This
        is a marked improvement over the non-hybrid 3.5-liter EcoBoost V6, which
        averages 18-20 MPG combined.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">
        In real-world driving scenarios typical of Oklahoma City and nearby
        Union City, drivers benefit from the hybrid system&apos;s ability to
        operate on electric power at low speeds and during idling, which is
        especially advantageous in stop-and-go traffic. The regenerative braking
        system recaptures

      <p class="paragraph-text">
        When comparing fuel economy to other full-size hybrid trucks, the F-150
        Hybrid stands out with its balance of power and efficiency. For example,
        the 2025 Toyota Tundra i-Force Max hybrid achieves approximately 22 MPG
        combined, while the Ram 1500 eTorque mild hybrid achieves a rating of
        nearly 23 MPG. The F-150 Hybrid&apos;s advantage lies in its superior
        towing capacity alongside fuel savings, making it a strong choice for
        drivers who need both.

        pressure, removing unnecessary weight, and adopting smooth driving
